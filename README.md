#  Notificoaster-iOS

A wifi enabled Arduino with a temperature sensor will measure the temperature of your beverage to be visualized by a mobile iOS app. 
When the target temperature is reached the user will be sent a push notification to their phone.

## Walkthrough

Users login with their email and password and are directed to the main page that shows a graph of the most recent hour of readings and target and current temperature labels.

The target temperature (used for the chart and push notifications) can be updated from the main page.
